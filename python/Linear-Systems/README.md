# Lines

An implementation of a line class that could be represented by the equation: Ax + By = k

## Normal Vector
For a line Ax+By = k, the normal vector is the one represented by the vector [A B]

## Basepoint
Two points that are found by substituting either the x or the y coordinate to 0.

1. Basepoint-1 by setting x=0: (0, k/B)
2. Basepoint-2 by setting y=0: (k/A, 0)
